== Answers Demo App

Inspired by 37signals' http://answers.37signals.com

Designed to just measure up how long would it take to recreate
a similar app - sans web design.

And it actually took around 6hrs to put together (because of
a few struggles with webrat)

Depends on:

  gem install bundler

To install it:

  git clone git://github.com/akitaonrails/answers_demo.git
  cd answers_demo
  gem bundle
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:seed
  ./script/server

Feel free to play with it.
