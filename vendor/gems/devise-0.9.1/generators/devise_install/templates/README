Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Setup default url options for your specific environment. Here is an
     example of development environment:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     This is a required Rails configuration. In production is must be the
     actual host of your application

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb:

       map.root :controller => 'home'
